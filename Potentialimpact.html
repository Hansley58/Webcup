                            <p>Relying too much on AI in the workshop could mean students don't get as much hands-on practice. If machines do tasks students used to do, they might not learn important skills they need for their future careers.</p>

            <p>To wrap up, while AI can help Mont Lubin College, we need to be aware of some problems it might cause. These include worries about privacy, job changes, and keeping student help personal. By dealing with these issues carefully, the college can make sure AI helps students without causing any trouble.</p>
